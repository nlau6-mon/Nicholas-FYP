# Nicholas-FYP - Mineral Classification Using SWIR Hyperspectral Data

This will be progressivley updated from the 28/07/2020 until the due date at November 2020

The following is a list of current code files, and the purpose of the file:

## NOTE:

The training data is too large to host on github and hence has been provided as a link to a google drive location, with a subsquent link provided for the labels. All Other Files can be found as part of this repository
